    <!--  TODO:

    Add both a save as HTML and Markdown button:
    <button>Save Markdown file</button><br>

    Add the rest of the markdown language, currently only supports header 1 and 2 as well as plaintext

    Styling needs some work but I'm putting that off till last minute since I enjoy backend much much more
